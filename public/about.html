<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Passionate about education, I started my career more than ten years ago. At a very early age, I had a dream: 
  I want to build the best school in my hometown, Molepolole.</p>

<p>With persistence, hard work and of course struggle, I am achieving my dream. It is not yet done. 
  Building a school takes courage. Most times, the way to do it is filled with obstacles and difficulties. 
  However, throughout the years, I have learned that discipline and determination are the best values to achieve 
  whatever we want in life.

<p>Nowadays, Brilla Kids Day Care and Pre - School is a reality. A product of my effort, my best achievement 
  in life. Filled with love, care and beautiful environment. We are waiting for you !
